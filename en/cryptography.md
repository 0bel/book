# Cryptography

Magic? You can say that. The following actions are all made possible by modern cryptography.

- Ensuring two pieces of data are the same without comparing any meaningful details.
- Encrypted storage.
- Sending a message securely to a designated recipient.
- Proving the authenticity of a publication.

We will deal with original data, encrypted data, and **keys**. A key is a parameter used to transform the data.
