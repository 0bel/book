# Data

Data, information, file... These concepts seems similar. But the key is that low-level data can be interpreted into high-level data in ways specified by their standards, forming layers that translate to each other. A single piece of data requires the addition of a standard as a context to be interpreted into a higher level. The lowest level, as you have probably guessed, is binary data.

When a piece of data does not have any context so it can only be read as-is without any understanding, it is called **raw**.

In the following chapters, you are going to learn about binary data and the most fundamental standards for data interpretation.
