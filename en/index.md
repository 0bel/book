# Knowledge precedes control.

This book introduces **established concepts in the computer ecosystem**, so you can use them to have more control over your own computers.

## What *is* IT50?

IT stands for Information Technology, a phrase that has fallen out of use in the 2020s. The reason behind this decline is the prosperity of services that make users ignorant of the technical aspects of computer usage. In this project, we reintroduce the technical concepts of computing to everyone who wishes to know them.

Our mission comes from the belief that everyone should have a high degree of control over their computer systems. To empower users to do that, we aim to provide a high-level understanding of how computing works. This project focuses exclusively on the established concepts in computer software.

We are aware of many other introductory guides, but we know why we are special. A professional software user does not have to be a programmer, in the same sense as drivers do not need to know how to make cars. Learning how things work at a *certain* level is the sweet spot for the vast majority of people, and this guide is built right at this sweet spot. If you are looking for a programming guide, then you aren't in the right place, but every computer user can benefit from the knowledge herein.

We try to build the best cognitive framework for our readers. We do not oversimplify concepts or make things unnecessarily amusing.

Indeed, driving is a useful skill, and so is computer literacy. We are sure you will find its significance.
