# Data

Data, information, file... These concepts look similar. The key to understanding concepts about data is that, low-level data can be abstracted into high-level data when there is context. There can be multiple layers of such abstraction. The lowest level, as you have probably guessed, is binary data. The data forms we directly interact with are typically at higher levels of abstraction.

When a piece of data does not have any known context so it can only be read as-is without any understanding, it is called **raw**. This term can be used at any level of abstraction.

In the following chapters, you are going to learn about binary data and the most fundamental standards for such abstraction.
