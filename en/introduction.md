# Introduction

## Organization of this book

Based on how the industry is built, this book organizes information into four levels:

<lm class="lm-concept"></lm>Concept
:   Including how concepts relate to each other.

<lm class="lm-standard"></lm>Standard
:   Describes the standards for the concepts. Most of the standards introduced in this book are open ones that any developer can adapt to.

<lm class="lm-implementation"></lm>Implementation
:   Describes major implementations of standards. Different implementations often have different functions, performance, and configuration.

<lm class="lm-application"></lm>Application
:   Apply knowledge in the above levels, combining the usage of software. At this level, complex considerations are taken to achieve best practices.

Levels can mix in a single chapter. We recommend that you do not skip levels. You will very likely not understand if you still do so. However, if you wish, you can read across chapters skipping higher levels.

## Be a good learner

In the community of professional users, people always learn. In this book, you are only going to learn the fundamentals that enable you to find answers yourself and solve some of the problems you have. That said, do not expect to be a very proficient pro user after reading this book. But to help you become one, here is some advice.

- Search your questions online first. Very probably, there are already people who have had the same question and even a solution. You will learn a lot along the way.
  - Especially pay attention to the post and answer dates to see if they were talking about your version.
- Find and master your tools. You will not learn a ton of software usage in this book.
  - Read the documentation of the tools you use. They can include usage directions and known problems.
  - Select your tools.
- Do not be afraid to ask questions.
  - Join a community.
  - Also, [be a good question asker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
