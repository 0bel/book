# Introduction

Based on how the industry is built, this book organizes information into four levels:

<lm class="lm-concept"></lm>Concept
:   Including how concepts relate to each other.

<lm class="lm-standard"></lm>Standard
:   Describes the standards for the concepts. Most of the standards introduced in this book are open ones that any developer can adapt to.

<lm class="lm-implementation"></lm>Implementation
:   Describes major implementations of standards. Different implementations often have different functions, performance, and configuration.

<lm class="lm-application"></lm>Application
:   Apply knowledge in the above levels, combining the usage of software. At this level, complex considerations are taken to achieve best practices.

Levels can mix in a single chapter. We recommend that you do not skip levels. You will very likely not understand if you still do so. However, if you wish, you can read across chapters skipping higher levels.
